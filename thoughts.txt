Idea 1:
Add secret rooms to every level with a hard boss that will be almost impossible to beat with the current gear.
The player will have to go back to these rooms at a later point to beat the boss and get some special gear only dropped by this boss.

Idea 2:
The should not take an hp based approach. The player will only be able to take x amount of hits depending on gear and other factors like maybe special skills
from a skill tree. As the player progresses further into the game the enemies will be harder to dodge and their movement will be harder to predict.
The player will also encounter different types of floors that might or might not make damage.
